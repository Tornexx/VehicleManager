Supercedes:
  Clean and format all vehicle inspection item names (create a helper that removes the underscores)
  Format Vehicle Weekly checklist for mobile

 FIXED - UI BUG - User view page buttons shift if multiple vehicles are assigned with different length vehicle numbers (i.e. 24 & 120)

TODO - Email
  Overdue Report Email

TODO - Formating

TODO - partials for roles
  Define Supervisor and Driver role access
  Create Partials for navigation bar for each role

TODO - Fix Mileage Object Bug
  If mileage is changed to lower than the mileage object mileages break
  Possible fix, current mileage is the updated mileage object.

bandaided - validations for current mileage changes
  "Are you sure you drove over 3,000 miles this week?"
   - this generates an error and not a validation
  "Are you sure that there are less miles on the vehicle than the last time you saw it?"
  - this generates an error and not a validation

Completed - Current Services highlight in red when the current mileage or date exceeds the next date interval.!!!
	Complete - Mileage extraced into a service object

Completed - User Signup
  User cannot cancel their account
  User cannot create new account

Completed - Users should only be able to see links that they have access too.
	Achieved by creating seperate partials for each role type
