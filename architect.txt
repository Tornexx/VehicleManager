If a new service is more than the current mileage shall I update the current mileage?


validations for current mileage changes
  "Are you sure you haven't seen this vehicle in over 10,000 miles?"
  "Are you sure that there are less miles on the vehicle than the last time you saw it?"


Current Services highlight in red when the current mileage or date exceeds the next date interval.


#When a user logs in I want them to be able to see their assigned vehicles#

Drivers should be able to edit their assigned vehicles mileage
Drivers should be able to fill out a weekly PM for their assigned vehicles

Users should only be able to see links that they have access too.
